This is a command interpreter for managing objects in an AirBnB clone project. It is the first step in building a full web application and is designed to help with HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

## Installation

To install clone the repo with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/JennyHolberton/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone
```

## Usage

To use the command interpreter, run the console.py script. This will start a prompt where you can enter commands to manage the objects in the AirBnB project.

The following commands are available:

    create: create a new object
    show: show an object
    destroy: destroy an object
    all: show all objects of a certain type
    update: update an object


The command interpreter can also be run in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$

(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
